  <h2> An unofficial East Coast Cruise August 2020</h2>
  <p1>  </p>
  <p> So as we sail our way towards the end of the Greenwich Yacht Club 2019 East Coast Cruise and I sit watching a seal pup on the bank opposite this idyllic anchorage in the Roach its time to write some notes on the experience.  This has been the fourth year I have looked after the GYC ECC and it is my last in that role, but certainly not the last ECC I will take part in. Over the last four years I have thoroughly enjoyed the planning, the talking, the honing of options for destinations, the help from various people and of course the trips themselves. This year we have had strong winds followed by decidedly not strong winds.   A week in the Thames estuary seems to always provide us with a broad spectrum of weathers although in recent years they do seem to have got hotter.  My intention has been to plan routes and destinations which can be got to by all sizes of Greenwich Yacht Club boats.  I know these can feel a bit tame for the larger and speedier boats but it ends up working reasonably well for all. Most of those destinations are not exactly new, there is only so far you can get in one tide in the Thames estuary, and despite ambitions for more adventure our furthest point is usually the excellent Royal Harwich Yacht Cub in the Orwell, ever hospitable and picturesque, an ideal rest day place. I had hoped to get into the Deben this year but a 27kn wind on a difficult bar and river entrance was not going to allow that to happen - maybe next time....
