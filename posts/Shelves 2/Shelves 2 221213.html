  Part book shelves part dresser this piece for the kitchen at Tyle House Oast is adjustable for varied needs while hopefully remaining elegant as a piece in itself. Before thicknessing the raw Oak and Ash timber in the wood store was indistinguishable and I was surprised to find I had such wide quarter sawn Ash planks to make the shelves, each with significant change in tone from heart wood to sapwood across their width. The verticals are English Oak, darker and more figured than American Oak. The design uses notched uprights of dimishing depth to support successive fixed shelves with intermediate adjustable shelves on dowels.    </p>
