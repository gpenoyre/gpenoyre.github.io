  <h1> An informal East Coast Cruise with Greenwich Yacht Club August 2020</h2>
  <p1>  </p>
  <p> In the absence of an official Greenwich Yacht Club East Coast Cruise due to Covid 19 protocols, a hardy group of sailors ventured out ‘unofficially’, but suitably distanced, on what turned out to be a rewarding if stormy week in mid August.  It was, as always, a pleasure to sail in company and meet at anchorages and harbours along the way; this time more anchoring than usual, perhaps to better distance ourselves, perhaps because it is so satisfying to drop the hook in quiet places and watch the sunset. Looking back at my previous posts I see a lot of sunset photographs, so only the best in future!

  <p>The first half of this year seems to have just been swallowed up by horrible circumstance but at last we can go sailing and it is a tonic to see big skies and distant horizons again. This trip it’s been big winds and bigger seas than Snow Goose has seen on our previous estuary ramblings. The boat performed excellently throughout, she is tough and steady and sails well with a bit of wind – she definitely has a preferred area of wind speeds, 12 to 17 knots, perhaps all boats do.
  <p>

  This trip I had the bonus of the company of my son Zephyr, who despite not having much cruising experience is a natural sailor, perhaps due to his long experience of that thoroughly intuitive kind of sailing, windsurfing.

  <h2> Day 1 Gillingham to Queenborough</h2>
  <p>
  <p>No wind to speak of at the start of this short journey down the Medway but rising to around 9 knots as we went and despite being a rather grisly afternoon it was somehow atmospheric to begin our week under the grey tones of wide Medway water and sky.  We joined the catamaran Tiger Lily at Queenborough, and five boats eventually rafted up on the (appropriately) grey visitor buoy as we were joined by Eos, Lena and Aeolus. The sixth boat Caroline V opted to anchor in nearby Stangate Creek. A convivial evening of mild social distancing made quite natural by the cockpit spacings of rafted boats.

  <h2> Day 2 Queenborough to Harty Ferry</h2>
  <p>
  <p>With the forecast suggesting better wind the following day friendly consensus decision making led us not to cross the Thames Estuary for a day and instead make our way to Harty Ferry in the Swale via the Kingsferry Bridge. With little or no wind we made sedate progress processing up the Swale to the bridge and went through after only a short wait. This lifting bridge which carries a road and railway line and used to be the only way to get to the Isle of Sheppey is now dwarfed by the newer road bridge which sails over the landscape and can be seen for miles. The older lifting bridge is a noble affair, like an ancient Egyptian gateway with its huge tapering concrete bastions, we slink through to a different world beyond.  From here after passing leviathan factories served by working wharves and various industrial ruins the Swale opens up to become a wide and peaceful body of water. The deep(er) water channel is narrow though and you had to concentrate on not wandering from the buoyed route. After anchoring at Harty Ferry for a few hours we decided to go on a seal hunt and potter downstream in a downpour to admire the colony of Grey Seals. Such relaxed animals, about 20 lolling bodies watch us watching them - Very rewarding especially returning to a beautiful evening on the anchorage, to enjoy the best of this excellent spot.
