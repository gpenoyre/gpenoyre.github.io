  <p>A new garden table â€“ light enough to be able to move about the garden with ease and strong enough to withstand the elements over time. I decided to make this table without morticed joints to avoid water collecting and rotting the wood. The top and the supporting frame members are in two kinds of oak using as small section frame members as possible while remaining strong. As oak has a tendency to move all joints and connections are bolted. We will see how it fairs in the British climate.</p>

  <p2>First thoughts. A simple frame on wheels for ease of movement. The first design consisting of two frames with a halved joint at the crossing in the centre of each frame was putting too much stain at that point. Second iteration using smaller timbers is much better cross braced, and more interesting.</p2>
